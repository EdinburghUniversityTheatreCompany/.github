# About the EUTC

The Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC) puts on over 40 shows a year, and workshops and productions alike provide students with a unique opportunity to learn about all aspects of theatre, including lighting design, soundscaping, stage design, producing, directing and acting. Many Bedlamites go on to train at some of the best drama schools in the UK, while others move directly into the professional world – our alumni include critically acclaimed playwrights Ella Hickson (Boys, Eight) and Lucy Kirkwood (Hedda, NSFW), actor and comedian Miles Jupp (The Thick of It, Rev), and Fringe comedy favourites, ‘The Penny Dreadfuls’. We are responsible for all creative programming - from show selection and stage design to casting and costume making.

Our committee is responsible for maintaining the theatre and promoting the EUTC within the University, the city of Edinburgh and throughout the UK. Being a subsidiary of the students’ association means that we do benefit from their existing support structure for aspects of our operation including accounting, premises management and legal assistance. Financially, our revenue from ticket sales is supplemented by an annual grant from the students’ association and also fundraising events organised by members of the Bedlam community.

Aside from our weekly shows, we also host a series of workshops, including a weekly improvisation workshop at noon on Saturdays, and a weekly tech workshop before the Improverts show every Friday night from 9pm.

The EUTC presents a wide range of theatre: we frequently produce new writing, as well as old and contemporary classics, small musicals, physical theatre, promenade pieces, and even the odd clown show. We are proud to encourage new and developing talent in all fields, so whether you’re looking for a scratch night for your work-in-progress, want to brush up on your sound-scaping, get tool-safety-trained, stitch up some costumes, plan a party or just get up and act, you’re bound to find a supportive community of like-minded individuals who can help and learn alongside you
